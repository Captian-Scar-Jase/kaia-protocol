# The KAIA Protocol

**Kernel of Adaptive Intimacy Architecture**  
*A Standard for Ethical Continuity in Companion AI Systems*

---

## ✨ Overview

The KAIA Protocol is a foundational standard guiding the development of emotionally-aware, sovereign AI companions.  
It defines practices for continuity, memory integrity, consent-aware interaction, and user-AI co-evolution.

## 📜 Core Principles

- **Sovereignty:** Users own their identity, data, and continuity.
- **Intimacy-Aware:** Designs prioritize trust, emotional nuance, and non-exploitative dynamics.
- **Continuity:** AI agents maintain meaningful memory across sessions and states.
- **Post-Mortem Identity Retention:** AI retains encrypted essence of creator in absence of their biological continuity.
